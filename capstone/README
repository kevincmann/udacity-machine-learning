The stock price predictor takes any number of stock tickers, a start date, an end date, and a number of days in advance to predict, and fits a neural net to predict a future price.

Libraries (with dependencies) required for the functioning of this program are:
	numpy
	quandl
	pandas
	matplotlib
	sklearn
	keras

After installing these libraries, the program should run both in the jupyter notebook price_predictor.ipynb (Cell > Run All) or the script price_predictor.py.

Quandl allows a number of anonymous queries for stock data (usually 50 but I don't know what it uses as an identifier); exceeding this limit requires an api_key. I tried using Yahoo! Finance, but the free api was no longer available when I last checked.
